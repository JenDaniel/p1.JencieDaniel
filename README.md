## The Current Microwave
The design of the microwave has become more complex over time with the number of functionalities that have been introduced. Microwaves nowadays have so many buttons that serve to do a variety of things. For example, modern microwaves have the well-known timer function to heat up the food for a number of minutes, ways to change the power, a popcorn setting, a dinner plate button, beverages that aren't labeled, and so much more.

Microwaves are used for a number of things and typically have a number of buttons that take up Unnecessary space and have

## Microwave Features

The microwave shown has:
1) An auto cook menu
2) Additional buttons relating to different items to heat up
3) Defrost, popcorn, beverage (beverage, if pressed multiple times, relates to different times for heating up beverages)
4) Power and clock
5) Stop/clear & Start/+30sec
6) All the numbers 0 - 9

## Complexity of Usage
### 1) Too many Buttons
This interface takes a lot of space and has a number of fuctions that are not commonly used.
### 2) Buttons that may seem helpful, can be confusing
The beverage button has a few selections that is labeled by numbers when selected multiple times, but the selection does not specify the type of beverage the number is associated with. In addition, the amount of time that users heat of their food varies depending on their preference. People who like their coffee piping hot may heat up the beverage for 1 min 30 secs versus an individual who may prefer to heat it up for just 45 seconds (which is the average).
### 3) Clustered User Interface
Although the microwave introduces colors such as gray and black, it is still difficult to navigate. This may steer users away from using certain various features and it may result in the user setting the time manually.

## Common Uses of Microwave
### 1) Reheating 
The most common use of a microwave is to haet up or reheat food. In general, people reheat food that was stored in the fridge. This can include things that were cooked within the home, food that was bought from a restaurant, or other items.
### Heating things that have microwave included as a possible way of cooking/heating
There are a number of items that can be heated using an oven or a microwave depending on what is available to the user, the time frame the user wants the food to be ready by, and the way the food should be consumed. For example, preparting food in an oven generally takes more time, but the method of cooking will result in a different end product when compared to a microwave. Ovens can be used to grill, bake, and toast, while microwaves do not commonly offer those features.
### Defrost
It can also be used to defrost, but a number of people resort to leaving food out to defrost prior to cooking rather than defrosting using their microwave because it tends to partially cook the food. This results in uneven thawing and that brings about a food safety issue in the sense that certain sections of the item may be partially cooked while other parts remain frozen.

## General Sequence of Actions & Feedback
1) Press the button to open the microwave, then place the contents inside and manually push close the door
2) Press "Cook Time" or directly enter the desired amount of time to heat the food (diplay will show the entry)
    1.1 Defrosting - enter weight of item and the timer will adjust the time accordingly
    1.2 Power - the power of the microwave can be adjusted by selecting "Power" repeatedly until the desired power is set
    1.3 Beverage - selecte beverage repeatedly until the desired beverage is selected (numbers are displayed and heating will begin without pressing "Start")
3) Press "Start" (timer will diplay the countdown as time passes)
4) Press "Stop" when the user wants to stop heating before the end timer rings
5) Once the timer runs out, the microwave will beep and display "End"
6) Press the button to open the microwave to take contents out and close the door manually

## Common Mistakes
1) Setting the microwave power and forgetting to set it back when proceeding to heat something else
2) Moving through the selections for beverages, not know which value is associated with which drink
3) Defrosting an item based on the weight that results in partially cooked food in certain areas, resulting in a health hazard

## My Design
The above design is the design I sketched out to improve the interface, usability, and overall convenience that a microwave should have. Keeping the standard dimensions of the microwave was important because homes, offices, and buildings are designed to fit certain appliances in certain areas. Changing the dimensions of the microwave may result in people not being able to place it where it should go or be able to place a specific dish in the microwave. To avoid that, the microwave is generally 30in x 15in x 17in (width, depth, height).

The interface takes up 1/4 of the width of the microwave and spans the height of the microwave. It includes the most common features that users utilize.

## The Details and Features
### 1) Setting the Timer
I created knobs for the user to use to set the amount of time they wish to heat up the food. There is a knob for the number of minutes as well as the number of seconds. The knob can be turned both clockwise as well as counter-clockwise in order to adjust the time. The yellow bar stands out so that it is easy to see. The start button starts the timer and the values in the knobs indicate how much time is remaining. The user can also stop the timer and it will reset to 0.
### 2) The Customizations
I used the known advantages of color from a medical standpoint and created customizations in order to fit in with the individual's needs. I created a dropdown for the customization of the microwave color. The default is a dark green because green is known to relax individuals and helps to relieve stress. I also included some common things that people deal with on the daily as well as specific conditions that may pertain to certain individuals. With research, I looked into the various colors that may help and will allow an individual to customize their microwave to the environment that may be the most beneficial to them.

### 3) Progress Bar
The progress bar serves to let people know when the food is done heating. The gradient moves from blue to green as an indication of when the food is cold and when the food is done heating. The rest box is a prominent indicator of the progress of microwave in it's last minute of heating. The progress box will make its way to the green side of the gradient as the microwave does its job. 
### 4) Sound Indication
When the timer has finished, a tune will sound rather than the blaring alarm like sound. It is meant to create an environment that is more calming and relaxing. The user can then open the door to take the food out or place an item to heat up.
### 5) Selections
When the user makes a selction, the color of the button will change as an indicator that the user is selecting that choice.

## Conclusion
The microwave that I designed is meant to be easy to use, conveienient for people, as well as customizable for the individual using it. it includes a number of features that are helpful in creating a good experience for the user. In addition, it can be tailored to any individual using it and is similar in size to a standard microwave so that it is eazy to have wherever the user feels it should belong.
