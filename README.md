##The Current Microwave
The design of the microwave has become more complex over time with the number of functionalities that have been introduced. Microwaves nowadays have so many buttons that serve to do a variety of things. For example, modern microwaves have the well-known timer function to heat up the food for a number of minutes, ways to change the power, a popcorn setting, a dinner plate button, beverages that aren't labeled, and so much more.
