## The Current Microwave
The design of the microwave has become more complex over time with the number of functionalities that have been introduced. Microwaves nowadays have so many buttons that serve to do a variety of things. For example, modern microwaves have the well-known timer function to heat up the food for a number of minutes, ways to change the power, a popcorn setting, a dinner plate button, beverages that aren't labeled, and so much more.

The microwave shown has:

2) Additional buttons relating to different items to heat up
3) Defrost, popcorn, beverage (beverage, if pressed multiple times, relates to different times for heating up beverages)
4) Power and clock
5) Stop/clear & Start/+30sec
6) All the numbers 0 - 9

This interface takes a lot of space and has a number of fuctions that are not commonly used. For example, the amount of time that users heat of their food varies depending on their preference. People who like their coffee piping hot may heat up the beverage for 1 min 30 secs versus an individual who may prefer to heat it up for just 45 seconds (which is the average).
